# LinkedIn Lunatics

A creative project for generating satirical tech and office culture parody cards in the style of Garbage Pail Kids. This project uses AI to create personalized, workplace-safe parody cards that playfully mock tech and office culture tropes.

## Overview

LinkedIn Lunatics generates parody trading cards that transform professional headshots into satirical, Garbage Pail Kids-style stickers. Each card features:
- A personalized parody name based on the subject's first name
- Themed visual props and scenarios
- A clean, cartoonish art style
- Professional-safe humor suitable for workplace sharing

## Prompt Structure

The project uses a structured prompt (stored in `prompt.txt`) that defines:
- Card style and aesthetic
- Visual elements and props
- Name generation rules
- Style constraints and guidelines
- Color themes and layout specifications

## How to Use

1. Provide the required inputs:
   - First name
   - Job title/role (for internal use only)
   - Clear facial photo
2. The system will generate:
   - Three themed parody name options
   - Five possible visual props
   - A final card design incorporating the best elements
