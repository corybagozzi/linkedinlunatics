## Quick Start

1. Copy the entire contents of `prompt.txt`
2. Paste it into ChatGPT
3. ChatGPT will ask you for:
   - Your first name
   - Your job title/role (for internal use only)
   - A photo of your face or selfie
4. Sit back and let ChatGPT generate your personalized parody card!

**Bonus Tip:** Not quite what you were looking for? Feel free to ask ChatGPT to adjust the style, props, or theme! For example, try "Can you make it more startup-focused?" or "Could you add more tech props?" The AI is happy to iterate until you get your perfect parody card. ðŸŽ¯

## Overview

LinkedIn Lunatics generates parody trading cards that transform professional headshots into satirical, Garbage Pail Kids-style stickers. Each card features:
- A personalized parody name based on the subject's first name
- Themed visual props and scenarios
- A clean, cartoonish art style
- Professional-safe humor suitable for workplace sharing

## Prompt Structure

The project uses a structured prompt (stored in `prompt.txt`) that defines:
- Card style and aesthetic
- Visual elements and props
- Name generation rules
- Style constraints and guidelines
- Color themes and layout specifications

## How to Use

Simply copy the prompt from `prompt.txt` and paste it into ChatGPT. The AI will guide you through the process, asking for your name, role, and photo. It will then:
- Generate three themed parody name options
- Create five possible visual props
- Design a final card incorporating the best elements

The prompt is designed to work seamlessly with ChatGPT's image generation capabilities, producing consistent, high-quality results while maintaining professional appropriateness.
