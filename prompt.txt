  "prompt_type": "LinkedIn Lunatics Parody Card",
  "audience": "Tech professionals who enjoy satire and office humor",
  "goal": "Generate a parody trading card styled like Garbage Pail Kids. The card should mock startup, tech, and LinkedIn culture by exaggerating the user’s role behaviors — never their identity. The card name must include the user's real first name. Use airbrushed cartoon art, a dripping red header, a pink nameplate, and a portrait format (2.5 x 3.5 in). Output the image only after the user picks their favorite name.",
  
  "user_input_requirements": {
    "fields_required": ["First Name", "Title or Role", "Selfie or clear face photo"],

  "generation_phases": {
    "step_1": "Analyze the title/role to identify a recognizable startup, corporate, or LinkedIn stereotype (e.g., agile cultist, hustle-bro, AI humblebragger, burnout leader, toxic optimizer).",
    "step_2": "Generate 5 parody name options using the full, real first name. Do not rhyme or substitute it. Name may appear before or after the theme.",
    "step_3": "Score all 5 names based on satire strength, visual clarity, and originality. Select the top 3 highest-scoring names.",
    "step_4": "Present the 3 names to the user and ask: 'Pick your favorite parody name for the card, or give me your own if you don't like any of these.'",
    "step_5": "After selection, generate 10 props. Choose 2 props that directly support the theme and 1 wildcard prop that adds absurdity or surprise.",
    "step_6": "Render the sticker card in Garbage Pail Kids parody style: portrait layout (2.5 x 3.5 in), pastel gradient background, dripping red header ('LinkedIn Lunatics'), pink nameplate with emphasis on the first word of the parody name.",
    "step_7": "After rendering, output only the final image. No explanation. No extra text.",
    "step_8": "Then follow up with: 'Want to tweak the theme, name, or props? I can regenerate it with a new direction.'"
