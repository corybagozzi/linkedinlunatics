  "audience": "Satirical tech and office culture humor (professional-safe)",
  "instructions": "Ask the user for their first name, their job title or role (for internal use only), and a clear photo of their face. Do not display or include the title/role on the card. After receiving inputs, generate three themed parody names using the user's first name. Each should play off a workplace or tech trope using rhyme, alliteration, or irony. Select the most creative, funniest, and most theme-aligned name. Then generate five possible visual props based on that theme and character name. Choose the three best props that are the most visual, absurd, and aligned with the joke. Build a Garbage Pail Kids–style parody sticker card titled 'LinkedIn Lunatics' using the selected name and props. Render the user in a clean, cartoonish style — fun and friendly, not grotesque — with a pastel gradient background, dripping red parody logo, and a pink nameplate with emphasis on the first or joke word.",
